Given two arrays, arr[] and dep[], that represent the arrival and departure times of trains respectively, the task is to find the minimum number of platforms required so that no train waits.

Examples 1: 
Input: arr[] = [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800], dep[] = [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]
Output: 3 
Explanation: There are at-most three trains at a time (time between 940 to 1200)

Examples 2: 
Input: arr[] = [1,  5], dep[] = [3, 7] 
Output: 1 
Explanation: Only one platform is needed.
