You are given a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [birthi, deathi] indicates the birth and death years of the ith person.
The population of some year x is the number of people alive during that year. The ith person is counted in year x's population if x is in the inclusive range [birthi, deathi - 1]. Note that the person is not counted in the year that they die.
Return the earliest year with the maximum population.

Example 1:
Input: logs = [[1993,1999],[2000,2010]]
Output: 1993
Explanation: The maximum population is 1, and 1993 is the earliest year with this population.

Example 2:
Input: logs = [[1950,1961],[1960,1971],[1970,1981]]
Output: 1960
Explanation: 
The maximum population is 2, and it had happened in years 1960 and 1970.
The earlier year between them is 1960.

Code:
freq[2051] = {0}

for [birth, death] in persons {
	for (year -> birth to death) freq[year] += 1
}

Final code:
Steps:
1. Calculate gain array
		1.1 Create a gain array with all 0 initially
		1.2 Loop over all birth/death pairs. For each birth, death pair, add +1 in gain for birth and -1 in gain for death
2. Calculate prefix sum to find the freq of number of people alive every year
3. Calculate the index where frequency is maximum
