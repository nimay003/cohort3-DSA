Q - You are given a string containing lower-case english alphabets. You need to perform the following operation as many times as possible: 
Take the first occurrence of each alphabet if it exists and remove it from the string. Eventually the string becomes empty. 
For example, let’s say the string is “ababcba”.
In the first move, we need to remove the first occurrence of each character ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’. It becomes
“ababcba” → “abba”
Again, we repeat unless the string becomes empty
“abba” → “ba”
“ba” → “”
Find the last non-empty value for the string.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "ababcba"
Output: "ba"
